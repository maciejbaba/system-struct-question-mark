# Windows System Structure Explorer

## Introduction
This project, developed in C#, is designed to explore and extract system structures within Windows environments. It aims to provide developers and system administrators with tools to access and understand low-level system information, such as hardware details, system performance metrics, and more.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites
- Windows OS
- .NET environment (either .NET Framework or .NET Core, depending on the project setup)
- Visual Studio or another IDE that supports C# and .NET development

### Setup
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git`
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in your IDE.
3. Restore any necessary NuGet packages if prompted by your IDE.

### Build
- Use the build command in your IDE, or build the solution using the IDE's built-in features (usually found under the "Build" menu).

### Run
- Set the main project as the startup project in your IDE.
- Execute the project using your IDE's run command (often `F5` or the "Start" button).

## Usage
Upon running, the application will start retrieving specified system structures. You can adjust the source code to target different system structures or modify the output based on your requirements.

## Contributing
